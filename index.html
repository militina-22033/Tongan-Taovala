<h1>The Tongan Ta'ovala</h1>
<p> A lot of you might be wondering what a ta'ovala is?</p>
  <p> A ta'ovala is a sacred and cherished part of the Tongan culture.It's a mat wrapped around the waist and tied with a kafa. You can instantly tell apart a tongan from anyone else just from their ta'ovala. It seperates us from Samoa, Fiji, and the other Pacific Islands. However the history and it's importance to Tongans is widely unknown.
  <p>I want to open a door and let everyone into Tongan culture and explain a bit about the ta'ovala and it's history</p>
